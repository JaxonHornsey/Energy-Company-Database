<h1> Energy Company Database </h1>
This project was designed to practice and learn about CRUD operations, database design and structure, the relationships between entities, types of joins between tables, the writing of queries, and connecting a MySQL database to a PHP server. The code for this project was written in the Visual Studio Code environment, using HTML, CSS, bootstrap for the front-end, and PHP, MySQL, and SQL for the back-end.

The project was based on the scenario of an energy company that needed to track customer information such as addresses, bills, and outstanding payments. The company also needed to keep track of expenses and products.

To complete this project, we first created a model and a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram to plan out the structure of our database. The model helped us to understand the requirements and the various entities and their relationships that would be needed in the database. The UML diagram, which was an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), provided a visual representation of the database structure, including the different entities and their relationships with one another. This helped us to better understand the relationships between the various entities and how they would be linked in the database. An example of our Entity Relationship Diagram can be seen below:

After designing the database structure, we used MySQL to create the actual database and wrote a python program to populate the tables with sample data. This allowed us to test out the database structure and ensure that it was working as intended. We also wrote various queries to extract insights about the company's clients, such as which customers had outstanding payments.

Users can use the website to fill in queries and retrieve the necessary information from the database. The results of these queries are displayed on the website and styled using bootstrap. An example of the results of a query on the website can be seen below:

Overall, this project provided valuable practice in database design, querying, and server setup. It also resulted in a useful tool for the fictional energy company to track and manage their customer and financial information. The website with forms for users to fill in queries and the use of bootstrap to style the results provided a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the database and retrieve the information they needed.
